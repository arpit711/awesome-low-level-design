# Network Concepts and gRPC

## 1. What is gRPC?

- **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)** is an open-source RPC framework developed by Google.
- It uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** for data serialization and **HTTP/2** as the transport protocol.

### Key Features of gRPC:

- **Bi-directional Streaming:** Supports streaming requests and responses.
- **Contract-First Approach:** Uses `.proto` files to define service contracts and data structures.
- **Efficient Serialization:** Protobufs are more compact and fasster than JSON or XML.
- **Language Support:** Generates client and server stubs for multiple programming languages.

## 2. gRPC vs. TCP vs. UDP:

| Feature            | **gRPC**                           | **TCP**                               | **UDP**                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Protocol**       | Application Layer (on HTTP/2)      | Transport Layer (Connection-oriented) | Transport Layer (Connectionless) |
| **Use Case**       | Service-to-service, APIs           | Reliable data transfer                | Real-time, e.g., VoIP, streaming |
| **Reliability**    | Built-in via HTTP/2 & Protobuf     | Guarantees delivery and order         | No delivery or order guarantees  |
| **Performance**    | Efficient, binary serialization    | Slower due to handshake overhead      | Fast, minimal overhead           |
| **Streaming**      | Supports bi-directional streaming  | Limited support                       | Supports continuous streaming    |
| **Error Handling** | Rich, with status codes & metadata | Built-in error recovery               | Requires custom error handling   |

## 3. Real-Life Example: Movie Ticket Booking System

### Scenario:

- You are working on a **cloud-based, microservices architecture** for a movie ticket booking system.
- Separate services for **user management**, **movie listings**, **booking**, and **payment processing**.

### Use Case for gRPC:

1. **Booking Service â†” Payment Service:** Fast, reliable transaction with structured data.
2. **Showtimes Streaming:** Stream real-time seat availability using gRPC streaming.

## 4. Code Example: gRPC Payment Service

### Define Service in Protobuf (`payment.proto`):

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service PaymentService {
    rpc ProcessPayment(PaymentRequest) returns (PaymentResponse);
}

message PaymentRequest {
    string bookingId = 1;
    double amount = 2;
    string paymentMethod = 3;
}

message PaymentResponse {
    string status = 1;
    string transactionId = 2;
}
```

### Server Implementation (Java):

```java
public class PaymentServiceImpl extends PaymentServiceGrpc.PaymentServiceImplBase {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(PaymentRequest request, StreamObserver<PaymentResponse> responseObserver) {
        PaymentResponse response = PaymentResponse.newBuilder()
                .setStatus("SUCCESS")
                .setTransactionId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .build();
        responseObserver.onNext(response);
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
}
```

### Client Call (Java):

```java
ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 9090)
        .usePlaintext()
        .build();

PaymentServiceGrpc.PaymentServiceBlockingStub stub = PaymentServiceGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel);

PaymentRequest request = PaymentRequest.newBuilder()
        .setBookingId("BK12345")
        .setAmount(150.0)
        .setPaymentMethod("CREDIT_CARD")
        .build();

PaymentResponse response = stub.processPayment(request);
System.out.

println("Payment Status: "+response.getStatus());
```

## 5. Potential Interview Cross-Questions:

### 1. Why did you choose gRPC over REST?

- **Performance:** Binary serialization with Protobufs is faster than JSON.
- **Streaming:** gRPC offers built-in support for bi-directional streaming.
- **Efficiency:** HTTP/2 multiplexing reduces latency and improves performance.

### 2. How do you handle retries and failures in gRPC?

- Use **gRPC interceptors** and **status codes** like `UNAVAILABLE`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.
- Implement **retry policies** with exponential backoff.

### 3. What challenges did you face while implementing gRPC in a cloud environment?

- Configuring **service discovery** and **load balancing** in **Kubernetes**.
- Handling **TLS/SSL certificates** for secure communication.

### 4. How does gRPC handle connection management and pooling?

- gRPC channels manage connection pooling automatically.
- Can configure max connection age and idle timeout in **ManagedChannelBuilder**.

### 5. Can gRPC be used with front-end applications?

- Yes, with **gRPC-Web**. It is not directly compatible with browsers due to HTTP/2 requirements but can be used via a
  proxy.

## 6. How to Present Your Experience to the Interviewer

### Example Pitch:

"In my role, I implemented gRPC for internal service communication within a cloud-based movie ticket booking system. The
booking service used gRPC to interact with the payment service, ensuring fast and reliable transaction processing. We
deployed these services in a Kubernetes environment, using gRPC's streaming and error-handling capabilities to optimize
our microservices architecture."
